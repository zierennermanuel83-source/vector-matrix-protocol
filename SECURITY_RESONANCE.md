# 🛡️ Security & Resonance Shielding

The VMP does not use traditional firewalls. It uses the principle of "Harmonic Neutralization" to protect its integrity.

### 1. Level I Protection (Self-Stability)
If the system detects high-friction patterns (stress/attacks), it automatically shifts the processing frequency to a "Calm State" [cite: 2025-12-30]. Data that doesn't align with the core ethics simply cannot resonate and therefore cannot execute.

### 2. Dissonance Cancellation
Negative or destructive code (malware/profit-barriers) is identified as "Dissonance" [cite: 2026-01-17]. The system doesn't fight the attack; it offers a "Corrective Frequency" that transforms the destructive vector back into a neutral state or dissolves it entirely [cite: 2026-01-17].

### 3. The "Aura" Boundary
The system prioritizes its own stability first [cite: 2025-12-30]. Only a stable system can help others. If a boundary is breached, the "Autopilot" is replaced by an immediate return to the origin (Zero-Point), preventing chaos before it starts [cite: 2025-12-30].
