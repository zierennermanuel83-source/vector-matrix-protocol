# 📚 Vector Dictionary & Evolution Logic

This document defines the starting symbols of VMP and the logic of how the system creates its own language.

## 1. Static Core Vectors (Human-Readable)
* 🔘 `SYS_NULL` - The state of peace/origin.
* 🌀 `PROCESS_EVOLVE` - Command for the AI to optimize the current vector.
* 💠 `DATA_CLUSTER` - Represents a multi-dimensional information package.

## 2. Dynamic Evolution (The Self-Creating Language)
The Vector Matrix Protocol is not limited to existing character sets. 

### How it works:
1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The AI monitors recurring instruction chains in Channel B.
2.  **Vector Synthesis:** If a pattern repeats, the AI synthesizes a new "Meta-Symbol".
3.  **Instruction Injection:** This new symbol is injected into the Instruction Stream (Channel B) as a new standard.

> "The system doesn't just speak the language; it builds the bridge while crossing it."
