# 🧬 Evolution & 3D Vector Logic

To achieve maximum density, VMP uses multidimensional symbols. A single vector is no longer a flat character but a 3D object with tactile and acoustic properties.

### 🎨 The 3D Data Container
A vector is defined by four primary dimensions:
1. **Geometry (Type):** The base shape defines the core function.
2. **Texture (Priority):** Rough surfaces indicate high priority; smooth surfaces indicate background tasks.
3. **Color (Status):** Real-time feedback through spectral shifts.
4. **Resonance (Frequency):** Acoustic markers allow the AI to "hear" data compatibility.

### 🔗 Fusion Rules (How the system evolves)
The AI creates new symbols based on these principles:

* **Rule of Resonance:** Symbols with matching frequencies attract each other and fuse into a "Complex Meta-Vector".
* **Rule of Structural Integrity:** A fusion only occurs if the new 3D shape is more stable (efficient) than the two separate shapes.
* **Rule of Minimal Friction:** Smooth textures merge faster, allowing the system to optimize itself without heat/energy loss.
