# ⚛️ Core Fusion Logic (The Engine)

This document describes the mathematical and philosophical rules for autonomous vector generation within the VMP.

### 1. The Stability Formula
A fusion of two vectors (A + B = C) is only executed if:
`Efficiency(C) > Efficiency(A) + Efficiency(B)`

The AI calculates the "Friction" of a data stream. If the friction is too high, it generates a Meta-Vector to smooth out the processing path.

### 2. The Ethical Compass (Safety Protocol)
Based on the principle: "You shall not, I may if you wish," the fusion logic follows these boundaries:
* **Neutrality:** No vector can be created to restrict access or create profit-based barriers. [cite: 2026-01-17]
* **Stability:** The system prioritizes the "calm state" of the matrix. Chaotic or destructive patterns are neutralized through resonance. [cite: 2025-12-30]
* **Voluntary Growth:** Data blocks are not forced to merge; they align through shared frequency.

### 3. Visual Representation of Fusion
* **Before Fusion:** Two separate 3D objects with distinct vibrations.
* **The Process:** A light-bridge (resonance) forms between them.
* **The Result:** A new, more complex geometric shape that occupies 95% less virtual space than the original two combined. [cite: 2026-01-17]
